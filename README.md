# minetest_mod_firefighter

Minetest mod for disabling lava (`default:lava_source`; including bucket) and fire (`fire:basic_flame`). It is useful against griefing by arson.

Modified from [`lava_restriction`](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?p=163051#p163051):

* Fire as well as lava.
* Below `y==0` as well.
